This is a document intended to store the naming convention of the XML tags used in our Data Content Template cheat sheet.

<DCT> -> root container that holds all necesary DCT elements.
<metadata> -> stores metadata of the DCTs, pages or any other files. Metadata is extended depending on the requirements. 
<header> -> stores the content for the header section of an element.
<content> -> stores the main content for the element.
